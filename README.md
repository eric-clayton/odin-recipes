This is the recipes project from the Odin Project(TOP)

In this project I have focused on improving my git commits and using conventional commit practices to improve readability of commits. I have also practiced creating an html structure using vscode shortcuts to improve workflow such as multiline edit using alt shift arrow key and skip to the end of the line with end end.
